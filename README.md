# MANets
``a novel SAR-ATR model by considering both CNN-based features and transformer-based features to further enhance the representation ability of SAR targets under limited samples.``
  
This is a PyTorch implementation of the "Multi-Level Attention Networks for Synthetic Aperture Radar Automatic Target Recognition" in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL). More specifically, it is detailed as follow.
